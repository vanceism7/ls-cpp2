# LS-Cpp2

This is a proof-of-concept language server for [cpp2]. We may end up writing the language server in
a different language, but since I've never done this before, starting here is the easiest way to
begin.

This language server relies on my personal cppfront repo which you can find at
https://github.com/vanceism7/cppfront (although hopefully I can get the changes merged upstream
quickly if they're useful)

**Note**: Make sure to use the `lsp-main` branch when building. This is the branch with my
most recent changes and additions.

## Features

Currently this language server has the following features:

- Error Diagnostics

- Auto Completion (somewhat, it's a little clunky still)

- Go to Definition

## Bugs/Anti-Features

This language server is super alpha level software (pre-alpha?) - it's totally experimental at this
point. As such, there are a couple things which aren't completely functional just yet; hopefully
we'll be able to smooth these out over time, but I wanted to list them out here explicitly so people
are aware of them.

1. ~~**Error reporting is one step behind.**~~  
   I was able to fix this with a PR from my `vjp/from-stdin` branch ðŸŽ‰

2. **Error reporting is incomplete**  
   `cppfront` doesn't capture all compilation errors; it only captures cpp2 related errors, which
   are mostly to do with enforcing safety, best practices, and proper cpp2 syntax. For example, In
   my own testing of cppfront, if you use an undeclared variable, you will get no errors. This is
   because cppfront isn't meant to fully compile a program, its only meant to convert it to c++, and
   then our normal c++ compilers handle the rest. This means the language server will be very
   incomplete until we incorporate the diagnostics from c++ compilers.

3. **Autocompletion is incomplete**  
   We aren't capturing all of the nice info we'd like to get for our autocompletion data just yet.
   For example: we aren't capturing function parameters, doc comments, or even the ability to grab
   child symbols (such as `person.name`, or `std::cout`).

4. ~~**Can't configure lsp server in vscode settings**~~  
   This is fixed now. You can set config settings under the `ls-cpp2` in the extensions category

## Contributing

I haven't given this much thought yet, but here's probably what you need to do...:

### Setup

#### Get cppfront with diagnostics

You'll need to build my version of cppfront to get the diagnostics currently (until a PR is
officially pushed in). Just pull it from my cppfront repo (and remember to use the `vjp/lsp-main`
branch!) and follow the build instructions like usual (Found at:
https://hsutter.github.io/cppfront/welcome/overview/#how-do-i-get-and-build-cppfront)

Once you've got it built, make sure its in your path too. Setting the path in the plugin config
isn't done yet.

#### Run the plugin

You can use the `Run and Debug` in vscode to run the plugin for testing.

#### Running tests

There aren't many, but you can run them with `npm test`

### Code Layout

The relevant code is in `project-root/server/src/`

- `server.ts`:  
  This is "main" file where the entire project is ran from. All of the lsp functionality stems from
  this file. I've started to separate things out into their own modules, but its still rough.

- `diagnostics.ts`:  
  This file contains all the main definitions we need for working with the diagnostics output from
  cppfront. It has the type definitions and the functions that let us query the data

- `definition.ts`:  
  Implements the go-to defintiion functionality. I think ideally, I want to separate every piece of
  lsp functionality into its own module so we can get `server.ts` really clean looking at the end

- `util.ts`:  
  This file contains very general helper functions that are used by many other modules

- Test Files:
  For each functionality implementation file (like `definition.ts`), I want to make a `*.test.ts`
  equivalent so we have an easy way to test each piece of functionality if needed.

## Other notes:

I left the original readme from the tutorial below, since a lot of it is still relevant

# LSP Example

Heavily documented sample code for https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide

## Functionality

This Language Server works for plain text file. It has the following language features:

- Completions
- Diagnostics regenerated on each file change or configuration change

It also includes an End-to-End test.

## Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ client // Language Client
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test // End to End tests for Language Client / Server
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ extension.ts // Language Client entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json // The extension manifest.
â””â”€â”€ server // Language Server
    â””â”€â”€ src
        â””â”€â”€ server.ts // Language Server entry point
```

## Running the Sample

- Run `npm install` in this folder. This installs all necessary npm modules in both the client and server folder
- Open VS Code on this folder.
- Press Ctrl+Shift+B to start compiling the client and server in [watch mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#:~:text=The%20first%20entry%20executes,the%20HelloWorld.js%20file.).
- Switch to the Run and Debug View in the Sidebar (Ctrl+Shift+D).
- Select `Launch Client` from the drop down (if it is not already).
- Press â–· to run the launch config (F5).
- In the [Extension Development Host](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension#:~:text=Then%2C%20inside%20the%20editor%2C%20press%20F5.%20This%20will%20compile%20and%20run%20the%20extension%20in%20a%20new%20Extension%20Development%20Host%20window.) instance of VSCode, open a document in 'plain text' language mode.
  - Type `j` or `t` to see `Javascript` and `TypeScript` completion.
  - Enter text content such as `AAA aaa BBB`. The extension will emit diagnostics for all words in all-uppercase.
